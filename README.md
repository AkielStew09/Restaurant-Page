# Restaurant-Page
A restaurant page to showcase dynamic JS rendering

I'm more excited to do this project because I'm starting to get into npm, node, and non-browser JS
in general. That's what I've been looking forward to. I really want to reach that level where I 
can confidently call myself a web developer, and be able to build and manipulate websites to my
satisfaction. This is looking like it will be a significant step towards that, as I can tell by the
 types of topics I've been studying leading up to it such as modules and bundling. It's getting 
complex and harder to grasp, using a lot of external code and code I didn't write nor do I understand, 
but I know this is part of the process and I'm ready to face it. One step closer to a being a full 
stack dev. Let's start!!!
